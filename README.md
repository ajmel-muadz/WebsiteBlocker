# WebsiteBlocker

This is a simple website blocker built with Windows Presentation Foundations (.NET) for
Windows computers. The application is still a work in progress. Mainly, I need to add
a timer for block sessions.

## IMPORTANT NOTICE

This is the first proper program I made in .NET WPF. I did not implement this project in a
clean manner and I now realised I should have utilised an MVVM architecture. Although the
final project is basically done, I would like to keep working on this and eventually
refactor the code.
