# WebsiteBlocker

This is a simple website blocker built with Windows Presentation Foundations (.NET) for
Windows computers. The application is still a work in progress.

## IMPORTANT NOTICE

This is the first proper program I made in .NET WPF. I did not implement this project in a
clean manner and I now realised I should have utilised an MVVM architecture. Although the
final project is basically done, I would like to keep working on this and eventually
refactor the code.

Another main feature I am planning to add is a timer feature for block sessions. That can only be
done once I refactor the codebase.

## How to install

This program is built for Microsoft Windows x64 (64-bit) machines. I think it also works
on 32-bit machines, but I cannot find one to test for.

To install the app, simply go to the sidebar on this page and download the [latest release.](https://github.com/ajmel-muadz/WebsiteBlocker/releases/tag/WebsiteBlocker%2Fv1.0)
Ensure you click on 'WebsiteBlocker.exe'.

Please note that this app also requires administrator privileges to run.
